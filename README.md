Summary of the Paper

Animal abuse has become an epidemic in Bangladesh. So it can be said that, does not matter the animal is harmless or fearsome, belongs from the roadside or the wild, they are not safe from us. Our predatory behavior rangers from fast running horse to birds with wings. They can’t outrun human cruelty.


Introduction
Fear the one who prays the predator, alas! We are the one! The practice of abusing animals is quite common unfortunately. This horrendous behaviour is caused by twisted perception towards animals, lack of empathy and psychopathic tendencies. Some twisted people do it for “fun”. Many people defend animal abusers by saying people are suffering too, why aren’t we focusing on that? Justifying one crime because another one is happening is not the right approach. This ignorant behaviour is normalizing animal abuse. This normalization is making little children have a bad point of view. Thus, the number of abusers is increasing. In this term paper we will show some examples of animal abuses that are very much on our face, but we still often ignore them. In short, we will know about the systematic animal abuse of Puran Dhaka’s horse pulled carts, Katabon’s animal market, zoo, mass murder of dogs in the name of population control and cruelty against cats and birds. We hope that these examples will help us empathize with those poor creatures more. Goal of this term paper is to create awareness against animal abuse.

Abuse in Amusement Sector

Using animals for display and amusement purposes can be just an alternative name for animal abuse. Zoos are one of the biggest examples of that. Dhaka national zoo displays the worst of it. According to Chandan(2018, July 10) Despite having 186 acres of land and government funding, it is turning into a graveyard for animals due to lack of care and mismanagement. In recent times, a picture of feeding snakes live rabbits got spread around the social media. The rabbit suffers for days until the snake feels like eating it. By trying to simulate the wild, authority is just showing the predator inside them. This cruelty is unnecessary for the well being of the snake, yet the ignorant authority is practicing such abuse. The scenario is almost identical in every zoo of Bangladesh. Old Dhaka is known for its traditional horse pulled carts. But if we give it a second look, it’s nothing but a tradition of abuse. Constant beating and restless work does put a tool on these gentle creatures’ health. Moving from the metropolitans, horses aren’t treated any better. The news of a horse being left by the owner on the beach to die as the pandemic shut down all the tourist activity in Cox’s Bazar will move every person with a heart. ( Alamgir, 2021).

Abuse on Cats and Birds

Studies show cats are abused at higher rates than dogs or other domestic animals in almost every category of abuse — beating, throwing, mutilation, drowning; also abuse towards birds often goes unnoticed as well. People in Bangladesh enjoy doing ridiculous things with cats. They throw heavy things like stones on cats without any reason. By a report in the capital Gandaria a cat enters a house. The owner of the house is furious at this. She poured boiling hot water over the cat. The amount of cruelty is such that the cats owner has to call the 999. Currently the most common forms of bird abuse are hoarding and neglect, though it is not only pet owners who neglect or hoard birds; breeding facilities, pet stores, and laboratories are where most cases of hoarding and neglect occur. While many people might like the idea of having a bird to keep them company, unfortunately, buying a bird to keep as a pet is cruel. From breeding to smuggling to confining them in a home, birds kept as pets are often abused and misunderstood. According to Schwingle(2021) recently, puppy mills are getting more attention as people are becoming aware of their cruel and exploitative practices. However, bird breeding mills are less talked about, despite having similar conditions. These breeding mills are often immense, housing hundreds of birds in rows in cages. These cages are not designed with the birds’ welfare in mind; they are designed simply to maximize profit. Thus, these cold, metallic cages are often barren, devoid of any toys or objects for the birds to climb and play with. Similarly, isolating birds in these cages is stressful, as these creatures tend to be incredCruelty on Tiger and elephant.

Cruelty on Tiger and Elephant

Human interference in nature has decreased due to lockdowns and various other reasons in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic. As a result, animals found a new independent life. However, in Bangladesh, it is quite the opposite. The killing of wild animals has increased even amid this pandemic. Thousands of stray animals, particularly cats and dogs, are threatened with starvation as their main source of food -leftovers from hotels and restaurants are almost non-existent due to the countrywide shutdown since March 26. Many cats and dogs have died without food. Animals lovers and welfare organizations are trying to provide food to stray animals in different areas of the city. Since March last year, two royal Bengal tigers have been killed. Two tigers were killed after being injured in a trap and in January this year. So, three tigers were killed in the last 14 months. Some 10 tigers had been reported to have died of natural causes. That means each year one tiger is being killed on average. As many as 12 elephants died in electric traps or were shot. However, From 2013 to 2019the number of killed elephants was between four and five on average each year. (https://en.prothomalo.com/environment/more-wild-animals killed-during-pandemic). As a result of the Rohingya camps, 44 elephants are trapped in the forest of Teknaf. Being in the Camp Main Corridor has become a problem for wildlife. When the elephants come forward for food, they kill the elephants to protect their habitat and cropland. The rest of the elephants will be endangered if the elephants do not have a place to walk and feed next to their camp.

Dog Cruelty and Relocation

The inhuman exercise of killing and relocating dogs has not only pushed them to the brink of a disaster but has also been a consistent phenomenon in an attempt to control the population of dogs throughout the country. Notwithstanding dogs are considered one of the most faithful animals, they are frequently beaten and culled for chasing vehicles as well as barking too much which had been witnessed by the country over many years. According to the news of daily star a dog has been beaten brutally with a stick and buried alive in Rampura. Though this incident represents a brutal sight it was also a spark for triggering a firestorm of protest among the animal lovers. Besides this incident stray dog removal has also violated the animal law. As per the local government (city corporation) act2009, the city corporation authority city corporation can relocate and even euthanize stray animals. In Bangladesh, more than 2000 people and an enormous number of animals pass away from Rabies every year, of which due to bites from rabid dogs 98 percent of human deaths are occurred. But in Bangladesh, there is only 6 percent of all dogs have rabies. In order to eradicate rabies 70 percent of the stray dogs have already been vaccinated across the city. So, it could be a good approach instead of relocating dogs to save dogs' existence in Bangladesh. Relocating dogs from their natural habitat cannot be a solution as it produces millions of problems in the life of a dog including in gathering foods. Furthermore, it Can potentially endanger a dog's life. A better world can be generated for the street dogs by means of a comprehensive and compassionate approach.

Animal Cruelty in Katabon

In the Katabon animal market, Dhaka, the horrible circumstances in which animals are kept have always been unacceptable, and remember that animals have a complicated emotional existence and may experience many of the same feelings such as suffering, joy, grief, fear, and rage. In tiny cages, many wounded and sick animals are held for hours, frequently without water or food. Animals suffer from horrible untreated skin conditions, while dogs walk in circles on flooring made of iron rods in cages. To appeal to customers, fish are injected with color dye and have their fins cut, while dozens of mice have crammed into cages the size of a sheet of paper. “So far, the government has failed to provide the animals at Katabon with the necessary protection. Not everyone turns a blind eye, though. Obhoyaronno, the largest animal protection group in Bangladesh, urged people not to purchase animals from Katabon and anywhere else for years and instead to adopt abandoned animals. In our society, the Government of Bangladesh and the lovers of all sorts of animals have to advocate for the need to conserve animals and to respect animals and be united in this matter.” (Islam, 2014).

Conclusion

The systematic abuse of Puran Dhaka horse carriages, Katabon’s animal market, zoo, dog mass slaughter to diminish their number in the city, and cruelty to cats and birds will be known by this term paper. Developing countries such as Bangladesh now have to pay attention to animal issues and associated difficulties. “The time has come to recognize that non-human animals play an essential and significant part in human lives. Appropriate laws are necessary to identify animal cruelty as a crime and impose realistic punishment in order for it to be possible to implement effective animal care programs” (Farhana, 2016, p. 85).  Many of you may disagree since experience reveals that the majority of third-world countries are not ready to adopt legislative measures. In addition to the legislative endeavors, it is our prime obligation to practice our distinct religion and moral education, for example, we must educate our children on the significance of a healthy ecology in each of our homes and the roles that the animals around us play in our ecosystem.
